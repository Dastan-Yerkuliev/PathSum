# Single Number

### Task
Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.
You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.


### Example 1:
Input: nums = [2,2,1] <br>
Output: 1

<br>

### Example 2:
Input: nums = [4,1,2,1,2] <br>
Output: 4

<br>

### Example 3:
Input: nums = [1] <br>
Output: 1

<br>

### Constraints:
+ 1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104
+ -3 * 104 <= nums[i] <= 3 * 104
 
+ Each element in the array appears twice except for one element which appears only once.
